            <p><h2><strong> Description</strong></h2>
                The cat is a small carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral cat, which ranges freely and avoids human contact.A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

        <h2><strong>Taxonomy</strong></h2>
        <p>
            The scientific name Felis catus for the domestic cat was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae published in 1758. Felis catus domesticus was a scientific name proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Alekseevich Satunin in 1904 was a black cat specimen from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.
            In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) fixed the scientific name for the wildcat as F. silvestris. The same commission ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct taxon Felis catus.

        <h2><strong>Ecology</strong></h2>
        <p>
            The domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world. It can live on the highest mountains and in the hottest deserts.It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands—even on isolated islands such as the Kerguelen Islands.
            
            The domestic cat's ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat has led to its designation as one of the world's most invasive species. As it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat. This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula.
            
            Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.Their habitats include small islands with no human inhabitants.The close relatives of the domestic cat, the African wildcat (Felis lybica) and the sand cat (F. margarita) both inhabit desert environments.Domestic cats still show similar adaptations and behaviors.
